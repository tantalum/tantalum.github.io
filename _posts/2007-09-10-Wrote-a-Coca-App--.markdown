# Wrote a Coca App!!


So me being the ADD fuckup that I am decided that I want to write pretty coca app for Macintosh. So I went out to Barns & Nobles and the only Mac Development related book I could find was about how to use Xcode. Well it had an example app as the introduction which I used as a starting point. I have to admit I didn't get very far after that. Any way I'd upload it for you all but blogger wont let me :-(.


On the other hand I ordered a copy of "Beginning Mac OS X Programming" or something like that from B&N. Can't wait to get it.
