 Well I'm posting this entry using gnome-blogger. I got my old laptop up and running Ubuntu again for work. I still have my Mac that I use for school and stuff I prefer to develop on Linux machines. I have written a whole three lines and I still don't see what so special about this app. I might as well use emacs and copy/paste. Any way hopefully I'll post some interesting stuff later this week.
