title: Continuing the FreeBSD struggle
---

So I got a freebsd 6.2 CD and popped it in tne mac and it booted up all nice and pretty. The installation was a breeze, freebsd saw both the external hard drive and my wireless card, gentoo didnt see my wireless.

 I installed a standard MBR on the external and I figures my Mac would see it and let me boot from there.... It didn't. So now I have and full FreeBSD install that I can't access. I know you can boot up from an external hard drive on a mac so I dont know whats up. I'll try and see if I can fix that today
