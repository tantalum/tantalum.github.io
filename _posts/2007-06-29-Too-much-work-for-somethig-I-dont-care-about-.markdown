title: Too much work for somethig I dont care about.

Ok so today at around 11:30PM I decided to go back to the link tester and write it in python.... Well that ment that I had to write a parser to get the urls. Which also ment that I had to handle relative urls which means I would have to write somthig to parse the value of the href attribute... In other words I have better things to waste my time on tonight
