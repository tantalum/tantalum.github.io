title: AppleScript and iCal
---

I started to fiddle around with apple script the other day. I down loaded an example script that exports you iCal events. I tried to write a trimmed down version of it but I keep getting this error that I dont understand. I just signed up at [MacScripter](http://macscripter.net) and posted my question so hopefully I'll get an answer soon
