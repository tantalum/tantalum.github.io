Today most people use LLMs as an information lookup and generation system.

Without some new breakthrough in AI that opens the door to AGI, we probably won't get any novel answers when we ask ChatGPT how we can monetize it. 

So how do you monetize a publicly facing, free to use, GenAI service like ChatGPT? Since history never repeats but often rhymes, we can take a look at what the previous generation of publicly facing, free to use, information lookup services, i.e. search engines, did. The answer is obviously advertising and promoted content. For where there is information, there is attention, and where there is attention there is advertising.

It's not hard to imagine someone asking about a workout plan and being suggested supplements and gym membership to go with their new plan. It also isn't hard to imagine a vibe coder writing a web app getting suggestions about the "best" three places they can host the app. Nor is it hard to imagine an image generation system to prefer to include the Nike logo over the Adidas logo by just a little bit in the content it generates. The amount of that favoritism will correlate to the amounts that Nike and Adidas big on their logo placement. This is the kind of truly context aware advertising that advertisers today can only dream of.

In short, the big on the future of GenAI today is like the bid on the future of search was back in the late 90s and early 2000s.

As with search today, there is going to be tension between Model Trainers and Providers (MTP) on the on hand, and content creators on the other. Model trainers and providers will want to consume and utilize the highest quality content while also maintaining control over user attention and providing as little as possible back to the content creators. Just look at the [tension between newspapers and search engines today](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47018/R47018.1.pdf). 

At the same time content creators will be motivated to have models trained on, and repeating and recommending their content and view points. Conversely, other creators will want their content excluded from LLMs training and output for privacy, ethical or financial concerns.

Just like search today, there will also be tension between Model Trainers and Providers and the users. The users obviously want quick access to the information they are looking for. The MTPs, on the other hand, want to surface information that provides them with the highest ROI. In other words MTPs will want to produce content that has the highest amount of "Promoted Thoughts" that doesn't trigger the user to switch to another information source. 

The world is afraid of some super intelligence taking over the world, but we haven't even come up with a shared understanding of what ["intelligence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) is. The world is also afraid of the internet being filled with [AI Slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop) and the [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), which will happen in form or another. I am here to add another fear to the list: OpenAI becoming the next Google, we replace SEO with MRO (Model Regurgitation Optimization), and replacing sponsored posts with sponsored content generation.
