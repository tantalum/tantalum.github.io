## What is the Fediverse

The Fediverse is currently the fastest growing social media platform. More importantly the Fediverse is a new paradigm and platform to build online social experiences, something we haven't seen since the early 2000nds. So what is the Fediverse and what does it mean to you?

Lets start with what the Fediverse is. Wikipedia defines the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) as:

> The fediverse (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of federated (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing [...] and file hosting, but which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other. 

More commonly the Fediverse is defined as the set of applications (e.g. Mastodon or PeerTube) that can communicate using the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol, the servers and groups that host the applications, and the users of those applications and the content they create. A key aspect of the Fediverse is that anyone can host their own instance of an ActivityPub application and expand the Fediverse. Another key aspect is that different applications can all intercommunicate since they all talk the same language, ActivityPub.

## Decentralization

Let's make all that more concrete. The two most popular Fediverse applications are Mastodon form micro blogging and PeerTube for video sharing. [Noc.social](https://noc.social/home) hosts a Mastodon instance and I have an account on that instance. I can follow other Mastodon users either on my home instance (noc.social in this case) or on other instance such as [infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/explore). I can also follow a PeerTube account, like [babbagebool](https://diode.zone/a/babbageboole/video-channels) because PeerTube also uses the ActivityPub protocol. A common, but imperfect, analogy is email. You can have an account on gmail.com and your friend can have an email account at hotmail.com and you can both still send and receive emails with each other.
